## Questions

As a network analysis, I wanted to find out the following:

* Who are the top influentials?
* Who is the most influential user?
* Which stocks are the most influential users talking about?
* Which events caused the most chatter?

## Preparing the Dataset

### xlsx2csv

+ A python utility which easily converts xlsx files to csv. Supports conversion of xlsx files with multiple sheets. 

+ Can be automated using bash scripting.

## The Dataset

### Dataframe attributes
```{r load all stream, include=FALSE}

stream <- readRDS("allStream.RDS")

```

```{r df_attrib}

dim(stream)

```
* Relevant columns
    + Tweet ID - int, unique tweet identifier
    + Date, Hour - date, date and time of tweet
    + Nickname - char, twitter username
    + Tweet content - char
    + RTs - int, number of times retweeted
    + Followers - int, number of followers
    + Is a RT - logical, TRUE == retweet
    + User Mentions - char, other usernames mention in the tweet content
    + Symbols - char, NASDAQ symbols in the tweet content
    
### Number of unique users (based on Nickname)

```{r unique users, echo=FALSE}

length(unique(stream$Nickname))

```

### Number of unique tweets (based on Tweet Id, RTs recieve a unique Tweet ID too)

```{r unique tweets, echo=FALSE}

length(unique(stream$`Tweet Id`))

```

## The Most Talked About Stock

A wordcloud derived from the whole stream was generated to show the most talked about stock.

**Figure 1. Wordcloud of the frequestly mentioned stock symbols.**

***

## Significant Events

When was there the most tweets?

The plot below shows the distribution of tweets and retweets during the course of the observation.

**Figure 2. Frequency plot over the whole stream.**  
![](images/freqStream.png "Frequency Plot of stream")


Verifying by code, we get the date with the most tweets as,

```{r day of max tweet, echo=TRUE}
twperday <- stream %>% group_by(.,Date) %>% dplyr::summarise(.,Tweets=n())

maxday <- twperday[which.max(twperday$Tweets), ]

print(maxday)
```

### Day of Max Tweets

At what time during `r month(maxday[[1]], label = T)` `r day(maxday[[1]])` did users tweet?

**Figure 3. Frequency plot of the day of maximum tweet count.**

## Measure of Influence

Three measures of influence [^1] :

1.  Indegree influence.
    + The number of people who follow a user.
    + Directly indicates the audience size of the user.
2.  Retweet influence.
    + The number of times others "forward" a user's tweet.
    + Represents the ability of the user to create content with pass-along value.
3.  Mention.
    + The number of times others mention a user's name.
    + Represents the ability of the user to engage others in a conversation.

## How Ranking Was Done

[Fractional rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking)

*  Rank of 1 is given to the most influential user and increasing rank indicates a less influential user. Users with the same influence score recieves the average of the rank amongst them.

***

### Deriving Indegree influence rank

Select relevant columns:
* Nickname - twitter username
* Followers

```{r indegrank}
indegRanked <- readRDS("indegRanked.RDS")
head(indegRanked)

```



***

## Deriving Retweet influence rank

* Filter to get tweets with unique Tweet ID.

* Select relevant columns:
    + Nickname
    + Is a RT - logical
    + RTs - integer count of the number of times the tweet was retweeted


```{r rtrank}
retwRanked <- readRDS("retwRanked.RDS")
head(retwRanked)

```

***

## Deriving Mention influence rank

* Filter to get tweets with unique Tweet ID & Is NOT a RT

* Select relevant columns:
    + Nickname
    + User Mentions - char string which lists the usernames mentioned in the tweet


```{r menrank}
mentionRanked <- readRDS("mentionRanked.RDS")
head(mentionRanked)

```

***

## The Top Influentials

```{r top influentials}
topInf <- readRDS("topInfTable.RDS")
kable(topInf[1:30, ], caption = 'Top 30 Influencers per Category')

```

Marginal overlaps were observed in these three top lists. The top `25` lists only had one user in common, `WSJ`

***

**Figure 4. Venn diagram of the top 100 influentials across measures.**  
![](images/top100Venn.png "Venn Diagram")

The top 100 lists also showed marginal overlap.

***

## Spearman's Correlation Coefficient

What rank matters the most?

The correlation done on the top influential users show a stronger correlation in their retweet influence and mention influence.

**Figure 5. Correlation plot across measures.**  
![](images/corrplot.png "Correlation Plot")

This means that in most cases, users who are retweeted often are also mentioned often, and vice versa.

***

## RT Rank and Mention Rank

Concluding that RT and Mentions are more relevant in looking for the influencers, we focus on finding the intersect of the two lists.
This information will also be useful later when we explore the influentials using a different method.

Looking for the top intersect, the top influential based on the two categories is `r findRTMenNames(8)`, the top 3 are `r findRTMenNames(15)`

## Network Graph

Creating a network object of the whole twitter stream involves the following data frames:

* Nodes - or vertices. In this case, all unique twitter users.
* Edges - or links. In this case, retweets and mentions.

Nodes and edges may have weights.

The `igraph` library is required to create the network object.

***

## Network attributes

A look at the resulting network shows the following attributes.

```{r BIGgraphObject, echo=FALSE}
twnet <- readRDS("twnet.RDS")

twnet

```

Network is **TOO BIG!**

But let's try to extract info anyway.

Density

Diameter, 

Hubs and Authority,
hs <- hub_score(compNet, weights=NA)$vector

as <- authority_score(compNet, weights=NA)$vector


***

## Creating a smaller network

To create a smaller network, the twitter stream of a single company is read and loaded.

A more manageable network object was created.

```{r smallNet, , echo=FALSE}

compNet <- readRDS("ca_compNet")

compNet

```

***

##Network Analysis

### Density
The proportion of present edges from all possible edges in the network.
```{r density}

edge_density(compNet, loops=F)

```

### Diameter
The diameter of a graph is the length of the longest geodesic.

```{r diameter}

diameter(compNet, directed=F, weights=NA)
get_diameter(compNet, directed=F, weights=NA)

```

**Figure 6. Network graph showing the diameter.**

***

## Hubs and authorities

The hubs and authorities algorithm developed by Jon Kleinberg was initially used to examine web pages.

* Hubs - more outgoing links
    + similar to a catalog with links to other pages.

* Authorities - more incoming links
    + presumably because of their high-quality relevant information.

### Hub
